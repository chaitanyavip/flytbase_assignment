# flybase_assignment

problem statement 1: 
Create a demo app by following the FlytBase documentation to make the
drone takeoff at 5m, move in a square trajectory of side length 6.5m at a
height of 5m, and land once the entire mission is over. Demonstrate the app
and fly the drone in the FlytSIM simulator.

solution : 
step 1: open the flytsim shell 
step 2: Directed to flytapp/onboard/python_app
Step 3: then you can find two python codes. One is square.py and the second one is triangle.py
step 4: run the square.py code for 1st problem with the command: python square.py 

problem statement 2: 
Create a demo app by following the FlytBase documentation to make the
drone takeoff at 10m, move in a triangle trajectory of side length 10m at a
height of 10m, and land once the entire mission is over. Demonstrate the app
and fly the drone in the FlytSIM simulator.

solution : 
step 1: open the flytsim shell 
step 2: Directed to flytapp/onboard/python_app
Step 3: then you can find two Python codes. One is square.py and the second one is triangular.py
step 4: run the square.py code for 2nd problem with the command: python triangle.py
